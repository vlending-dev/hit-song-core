# HIT-SONG-CORE

## 1. [Introduction](#introduction)
This is a simple project that uses the Spotify API to get the top 10 songs of a given artist. The project is written in Python and uses the Flask framework to create a simple web server that serves the top 10 songs of a given artist. The project is divided into two parts: the backend and the frontend. The backend is responsible for fetching the top 10 songs of a given artist from the Spotify API and the frontend is responsible for displaying the top 10 songs of a given artist in a simple web page.
## 2. [Installation](#installation)
To install the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you have Python installed on your machine, you can install the project by following these steps:

## 3. [Usage](#usage)
To use the project, you need to run the backend and the frontend separately. To run the backend, you need to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
from hitsong import in_memory_storage


```

This will start the Flask web server on port 5000. To run the frontend, you need to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash

```

This will start the Flask web server on port 8000. Once both the backend and the frontend are running, you can open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 to see the top 10 songs of a given artist.
